Google Event
November 19, 2009

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.150
Washington, D.C.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.319
&gt;&gt;Jonas Klink: All right.
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.070
My name is Jonas Klink.
And I'm the product manager for the accessibility

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.510
team here at Google.
And we're very, very excited to have you guys

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.170
here today.
I want to extend a really, really warm welcome

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.670
and thank you all for coming here.
I know a lot of you are local.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.460
But it's still early in the morning.
And we're thrilled to have you here.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.239
I think we're going to have a great event
today.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.420
And I look forward to showing you the demo
that we have going today.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.659
We have an agenda here behind me.
After I do the brief introduction that I'm

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.809
blocking, I'm going to hand it over to Vint
Cerf.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.100
We're then going to have Ken and Naomi do
some demos.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.209
Vint will come back to provide a wrap-up.
And then we'll do some Q&amp;A towards the end.

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:03.249
The bulk of us, the majority, will be available
afterwards to give some additional demos,

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.150
answer more questions, anything you haven't
gotten to.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.460
So we're really thrilled to have Vint Cerf
with us.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.120
His title here at Google is vice president
and chief Internet evangelist.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.340
And -- but as many of you know, he's a lot
more than that.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.600
He's widely known as the father of the Internet,
as one of the codesigners of the TCP/IP protocol

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.600
and the basic architecture of the Internet.
He, to us, which might be widely known, he's

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.600
really, really critical as an unwavering supporter
for an accessible Internet, and especially

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.100
for those who have special access needs.
So without further ado, we're really thrilled

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.280
to have him here.
And I give you Vint Cerf.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.840
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Thank you, all, very, very much

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.680
for coming.
And welcome to Google's D.C. office.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.880
It's these kinds of events that have made
us so happy to have this facility here.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.769
And I hope during the course of 2010, we will
see you back here for other kinds of announcements

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.980
related to our work in accessibility.
Let me start out by -- I'm standing in front

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.829
of these darned slides.
How can we do this so I'm not in the way,

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.499
as I fall off the side?
Okay.

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.939
Can I get the first slide, please.
There we are.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:31.189
Everyone should know by this time that Google's
motto is to organize the world's information

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:37.499
and make it accessible and useful.
And accessible is a really important word

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.019
in the context of what we're going to talk
about today.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.019
Accessibility comes in a wide range of features.
There are issues for people who are deaf or

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:55.499
hearing-impaired, or people who have visual
impairments, who have low vision or no vision,

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.189
people who have motor problems, and things
like that.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.680
Google believes that the world's information
should be accessible to everyone.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.639
And our interest is in finding ways to achieve
that objective.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.760
We're far from solving the problem completely.
But today's discussion and announcements will

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.989
show you what I consider to be an important
step in that direction.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.599
I'm going to cheat and look at my notes.
Hold on.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.599
And I have to use my damned glasses to do
it.

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.279
I hate to admit that I have to wear these
things.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.259
Inside of every 66-year-old is a 16-year-old
wondering what happened.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.950
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: So I want to tell you, first

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.609
of all, why accessibility's personally important
to me.

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.459
Sigrid, who is in the audience over there
 -- wave your hand, Sigrid -- and I are both

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.489
hearing-impaired.
Sigrid was totally deaf for 50 years.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.469
She now has two cochlear implants.
And they work wonderfully well.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.129
They work so well, we had to buy a bigger
house, because she wanted bigger parties,

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.029
because she could hear.
So this is a technology which is spectacular.

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.680
I've been wearing hearing aids since I was
13.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.099
You can do the math.
That's 53 years.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.250
So both of us care a great deal about how
technology can help people with various impairments

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.160
get access to information and be connected
with the rest of the world.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.810
So quite apart from my job at Google, I have
great personal interest in what we're talking

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.810
about today.
You know, YouTube is another part of the Google

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.720
family.
And you saw the signs, I hope, that said Google

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.920
and YouTube are hosting this meeting.
YouTube uncovered an extraordinary desire

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.570
by the world's population to express itself
using the video medium.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.630
And one of the big challenges of the video
medium is whether it can be made accessible

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.480
to everyone.
It's a little hard to make video accessible

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.270
to people who are blind.
You need to have some kind of descriptive

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.140
ability there.
But for people who are deaf, that's another

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.540
important area of concern, because they may
not be able to hear people speaking.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.890
So video has turned out to be a stunningly
important new medium for personal expression.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.890
You may not know the statistics, but there
are 23 hours of video uploaded into YouTube

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.660
every minute.
23 hours of video per minute.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.730
Now, I have no idea how many hours of video
are actually being watched, but I think the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.730
answer is bigger than that, although, for
some videos, it may be like blogs, the average

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.910
number of readers of a blog is probably 1.1,
the person that wrote the blog and his dog.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.230
But these videos are often extremely popular.
And if you haven't noticed, they have become

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:04.230
an important medium of political expression.
You saw this very evidently in the post-Iran

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:11.220
elections, where many people used video and
YouTube, in particular, to tell the rest of

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.220
the world what was going on in that country.
Well, we started our life at Google as a company

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.850
that was indexing the Internet.
We crawled through all the billions of pages

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.780
on the net and we try to index them and then
help people find the information that they're

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.090
interested in.
We'd like to extend that ability to find information

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.600
to other media besides text.
And so part of what we are about at Google

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.170
is finding other ways of indexing content
that may not necessarily be purely textual

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.510
in nature.
We move very, very quickly when it comes to

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.780
new ideas.
And we usually get them out there early.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.350
So beta testing is a very common thing for
us.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.240
We put new products out there and find out
what people do with them.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.460
An example of this is Google Wave, where we
put that out very, very early in its development.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.490
And we're discovering very interesting things
about how people use this combined communication

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:21.490
tool, which incorporates blogging, instant
messaging, e-mail, and many other forms of

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.670
interaction.
We're very interested in picking up other

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.390
kinds of content than text.
So you see this with Google Earth.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.110
You see it with Google Maps.
And you see it with attempts to allow people

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:41.680
to express information or display information
that's geographically indexed by using our

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.680
Google Earth and Google Maps facilities.
We're looking for all kinds of ways of improving

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.000
people's ability to find information.
So some of you may be using the Google Toolbar,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
which we put -- or make available so that
you can easily invoke a Google search.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:08.270
We're also very interested in internationalization.
We've recently announced that we are capable

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.330
of searching and translating 51 different
languages.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.030
Now, there are some linguists in the crowd.
I'm going to pick on my good friend Marc Okrand,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.389
who is a wonderful linguist at the National
Captioning Institute.

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:27.680
I know you have heard this, but I have to
tell everybody, Marc is the inventor of the

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.560
Klingon language.
He's a linguist.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.719
And I'm sure he can appreciate the translating
51 languages into 51 other languages, which

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:43.360
is a nontrivial exercise.
I also have to admit that we don't do equally

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.870
well with all language pairs.
I tried Chinese to Danish while I was in Copenhagen

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.810
earlier this week.
And since I don't speak either language, I

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.840
don't know how well or poorly I did.
But I noticed there were some chuck unless

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.700
the Danish-speaking audience.
But the point here is that we recognize accessibility

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:09.700
as being another -- accessibility by way of
language as being another important kind of

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.370
accessibility.
So I want to get the first slide up -- or

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.620
next slide up, if I could.
It's up there now.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.430
Okay.
So what we're seeing here are some statistics

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.890
basically, relative statistics of the number
of people who speak various languages who

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:24.080
are on the Internet.
But you'll notice that the blue-colored bars

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.420
illustrate people who have accessibility challenges.
So there are more people with problems of

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.640
color vision than there are Japanese or Spanish
or German or French or of the other language

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.200
speakers.
Or people with poor vision exceed and represent

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.550
a significant part of the Internet user population,
or people with poor dexterity, or people who

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:51.360
are deaf or hard of hearing and blind.
So what we're saying here with these data

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.270
is that there are a significant number of
people in the Internet population who will

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:03.270
benefit from improvements in accessibility.
And we recognize this on a global scale.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:09.930
We try to serve users, all 1.7 billion of
them who are online on the Internet today.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:16.930
And we would like to improve the ability of
our users who have disabilities to get access

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:24.740
to the information that we can provide.
So let me just give you a couple of examples

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.010
of the things that we do.
In Google Applications or Google Apps, we've

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:37.010
been focusing on keyboard access and the use
assistive technologies like screen-readers

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.710
to make the information available more accessible
to people who can't see.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.760
We've released android operating system for
mobiles.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.610
And our intent was to keep that as open as
possible.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.770
It's an open source operating system.
People can add functionality to it.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:02.400
And one of the things we would like to facilitate
is the addition of assistive methods to make

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.890
the operating system more useful in a mobile
context for people who need help.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:15.220
We also released a browser called Chrome.
And in addition to its security properties,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.620
which we believe are superior, it is also
an open platform, one in which assistive mechanisms

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:28.000
can be incorporated.
And, finally, YouTube itself, in 2006, added

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the ability to put captions up on the YouTube
videos if the supplier of that video had captioning

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.560
transcripts available and could insert them
into the video.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:47.930
So we're very interested in helping people
with that kind of information to make it easily

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.060
accessible to the rest of the world.
So I'm going to stop here and just remind

00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.060
you again that Google is fully prepared to
pursue accessibility features in all of our

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.220
products and services, and we're here to tell
you about some specific ones today.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.700
And to do that, I want to introduce my good
friend Ken Harrenstien.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.870
Ken and I have known each other for probably
over 30 years.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.460
I think we were two or three years old at
the time when we met.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.089
Ken was at SRI International on the West Coast.
He and I worked on something called Deaf Net,

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:31.089
which was an extremely early attempt to bring
terminal access to the Internet to people

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:37.670
who were using TTYs and things of that kind.
I would say we had mixed results with that

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.330
experiment.
But we learned a lot from how much value there

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.220
came from having access to the Internet through
these tools.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:53.220
But in the meantime, Ken has joined Google.
And of all the people that I know at Google,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.730
Ken has been the strongest proponent and one
of the strongest technical contributors to

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:07.740
our accessibility initiatives.
He's very, very vocal and passionate on the

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.970
subject.
And he's going to show you what he and his

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:16.420
colleagues have been able to do in this area.
So, Ken, thank you so much for coming here

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:23.400
to the East Coast.
Let me turn the microphone over to you.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.400
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Thank you, Vint.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:36.960
Hi, everyone.
My name is Ken Harrenstien.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.640
As you can see, I'm a software engineer, and
I work for Google.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.640
It's always such a great honor to share the
stage here with Vint.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:56.800
But for me personally, it's even a bigger
honor to have all of you here, because I know

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:03.800
for all of us, we've worked many, many years
diligently pursuing the same goal.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.850
We share the same frustrations.
And today I'm really happen to be able to

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:15.060
share something that we hope that will reach
this goal of accessibility, something we've

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:22.060
worked on hard.
Since some of you probably don't know a lot

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:34.420
about YouTube and the captioning services
that we can do, I'd like to start by reviewing

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.800
quickly some of what we already provide.
And then we'll talk about the problems that

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.800
we're facing.
And lastly, we'll talk about how we're trying

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.800
to solve those problems.
First, I'll start with a little demonstration.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.870
This video is one we made when we first launched
captions on YouTube.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:04.870
It was really fun making it.
So let me play some.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:12.410
As you can see, I'm changing the size.
People want to see sometimes more video than

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.050
they want to see captions.
But if you're in the back, you may want to

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:32.050
see them a little bit bigger.
Is that better?

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:40.350
I'll explain the details later how to do it.
Also, for some people who want to see more

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:52.790
of the video, you can turn off the background.
That's an option.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:57.029
Most people like the black background, as
it makes it easier to read.

00:15:57.029 --> 00:16:03.200
So I'll leave it on that way.
Can you read this all right?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.200
Is that

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:55.890
all right for everyone?
I should look in the back there.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:02.680
Okay.
Let me play a little bit.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.720
(Video).
(No audio).

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.760
[ Laughter ]
(Speaking French).

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.829
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: He's speaking French.
(Video.)

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:17.829
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Now, Japanese is being
spoken.

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:25.760
This person here, his name is HIROTO.
He's our product manager.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.640
He's done a great job.
Unfortunately, he couldn't come here today.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:36.640
But he's here on video.
So what I just demonstrated is how captions

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.740
have made videos accessible to everyone.
It doesn't matter if you can hear or not.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.160
You know, for people who don't understand
Japanese, if you don't understand sign language,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:56.530
it's all made accessible through captions.
Now, suppose English isn't your first language.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:02.740
This has several captions that are already
uploaded.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:09.740
So I'm able to pick another language.
I'll pick this one.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:23.620
And does anyone speak this?
(Non-English language).

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:36.220
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Now, suppose in that list
of prepared captions you don't see the language

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.320
that you want.
As Vint mentioned already, we support 51 languages.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:52.390
So it's possible to translate to any one of
those other languages.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:59.390
Some are better than the others.
But let me show you.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.250
See this one?
It says "translate captions."

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:14.250
So I'll pick that.
Now it's translating from English to -- let's

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.970
pick one.
Normally, I like to ask people to help me

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.600
pick.
But I know there's a few people who do speak

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:29.600
French.
So I'm going to go ahead and choose that.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:40.790
&gt;&gt;Video: (Captions French).
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: What do you think?

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:57.540
Is it okay?
He still is speaking Japanese, but we can

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:08.260
read it in French.
Those things are wonderful for accessibility.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.860
But there's another very cool benefit of having
captions.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:26.860
Because they are text, we can search on them.
There's two things that we can do with that.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.380
It helps you find the video you're looking
for.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.470
And, secondly, it helps you find the exact
text you want within the video.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.120
Let me show you that.
It's called a snippet.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.970
And you can jump directly to the snippet within
the video that you're searching for.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:50.970
So let me demonstrate that next.
Here, we see the page from Google.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:00.390
It's an advanced video search page.
I've already put in the phrase that I want

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.480
to search for.
"That's one small step."

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:10.480
This is one of my favorites.
I've also checked this box "Search only closed-captioned

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:17.410
videos."
So we check that box.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:24.410
So here we go.
I found several.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:34.480
It happens to know what I want.
Now, you'll notice, it found snippets.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:52.200
And you'll know that by offering this option,
start playing at search term.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.460
So I'll click that.
And it will jump me right there.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:01.570
Well, actually, it jumps to a place just a
little bit before, because it knows that you

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.220
want a little bit of context first.
It's slightly long, but I hope it's okay.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:13.220
&gt;&gt;Video: Today, the Google lunar X-prize is
challenging free enterprise to reach much

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:23.419
further, to the moon, to pave the way to harnessing
its wealth of resources.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:33.150
Only days away, its earth's partner in a unique
two-world system.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.010
That's one small step for man, one giant 
--

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.660
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: For a short video, it may
not be that important.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.530
But if you have a really long video, this
ability is very important.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:51.590
This is one of my favorite features.
And, remember -- well, I actually had the

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.720
opportunity to watch this live on TV years
ago.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.640
But, of course, at that time, there were no
captions, as you know.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:04.640
But now, I get to see it.
Those things are all there.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:20.070
And they have been there in YouTube.
Since we first launched captions more than

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:31.669
a year ago -- I'm sorry, 2008, not '06 --
 we're very surprised and pleased at how many

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.500
videos have captions.
There's a few hundred thousand videos that

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:47.500
are captioned within YouTube.
And we think that's a great number.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.250
So what do you think the problem is?
Let me show you.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:59.250
(Video).
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Let me explain here.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:16.700
I tried to figure out a way to explain without
including a lot of math what this problem

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.160
is that we're encountering.
So I came up with a visualization.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.030
You know the network is built with a bunch
of pipes.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:31.789
The Internet is built with a bunch of pipes.
It's true.

00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:34.590
And a lot of water runs through these Internet
pipes.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:40.049
And they are really video.
Okay?

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:46.490
I happen to have some of that video here.
Okay?

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.150
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: This is special water.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.450
It happens to be captioned, captioned video.
As you see, the water has -- the bottle has

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.650
words on it.
It's captioned.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:04.650
It's prepared for you. But --
(Video playing.)

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:15.919
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: This is our problem.
Remember what Vint said earlier?

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:27.730
Every minute we stand here and talk, people
are uploading 20 to 23 hours of video.

00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:33.360
Not minutes.
Hours.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.490
Not 23 videos themself.
We're talking hours.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.419
So tons.
And that's every minute, every day.

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:43.520
Every month.
It just -- it's coming in.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:50.520
(Video).
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Okay.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:02.410
So do you see any bottles there?
Can't see any.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:09.410
Unfortunately, of all that content being uploaded,
just a small amount is captioned.

00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:17.960
Very small.
[ Music ]

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:24.960
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: So the question is, who's
going to bottle that water?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:39.200
At Google, we call that a problem of scale.
How to scale.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.880
Fortunately, at Google and YouTube, our leaders
are very passionate and want to support the

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:56.840
solutions that address scale.
Maybe you're not familiar with that word.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:04.520
But our CEO, his name is Eric Schmidt, he
loves to talk about this issue.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.960
And he's a very clear speaker.
So I would like to borrow some of his words.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:18.960
&gt;&gt;Video: -- tell you that it's time.
It's time for us to take advantage of the

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:24.299
amazing opportunity that is before us.
And that's what I want to talk about.

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:27.299
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Do you notice anything
different about these captions?

00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:32.070
No?
Let me play some more.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.299
&gt;&gt;Video: -- today and tomorrow, you're going
to have interesting product announcements,

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:42.070
some fun stuff, and perhaps most important,
you're going to spend time with the best programmers

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:48.210
in the world who are here in the room.
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Do you notice anything

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.669
different?
There's some mistakes.

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:58.669
What do you see?
Yes.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:07.700
Yes, there's no person who made these captions.
This was machine-made.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.140
Yes, it's true.
We did it.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.919
This is finally it.
We got it.

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:18.919
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: Yes.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:25.980
I am so excited and so proud, pleased to announce
that we are launching this, the speech recognition

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:34.240
and YouTube combined to make captions.
[ Applause ]

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:41.760
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: And first, a little enjoyment.
Let me add something else here.

00:28:53.059 --> 00:29:00.059
&gt;&gt;Video: -- literally, you all.
And we're very excited to have you here.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
From my perspective, it's time.
We have spent 20 years trying to build a programming

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:21.539
model that's the --
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: It's good, yeah?

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:25.090
It's good.
Completely machine-generated.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:32.090
Speech recognition to English to French.
I -- when you think about that, what it means,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.720
it's wonderful.
I mean, I just love this Internet.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.059
It's just so exciting to see this.
I've been dreaming about this day for so many

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:42.590
years.
I mean, I'm just so excited to see it's actually

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:49.590
happened.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:30:00.150
I do need to caution you a little bit.
For this very early launch, you can only see

00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:08.059
those machine-generated captions we call automatic
captions, auto captions, you can only see

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:17.020
them for 13 educational partners who have
agreed to join into this early launch.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:23.750
Of course, we want to increase that number,
add more channels and partners, as fast as

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:30.750
we can.
I want to show you how people will turn on

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:38.330
this feature when it becomes available.
Let me do another one here.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:44.740
&gt;&gt;Video: -- details are located at that URL.
We will take submissions for the contest in

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.559
August.
Judging will occur through the fall and we'll

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:54.559
announce our winners in the fall.
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: There's no captions.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:03.360
Now, you notice a new option.
It says "transcribe audio."

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:10.580
Let me pick that one.
What comes up is a box.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:17.919
I'm not sure if all of you can read it.
It says transcribe audio is an experimental

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.669
service that uses Google's speech-recognition
technologies to provide automated captions

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:29.630
for video.
That box will come up every time.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.900
I know it might be annoying, but it's very
important.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:37.750
Because being an early and new launch, we
want to make it clear to people that these

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:43.049
captions are not from the owner of the video.
They have nothing to do with this.

00:31:43.049 --> 00:31:47.970
We're trying to generate these for you as
best as we can.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:54.520
And you will see why.
&gt;&gt;Video: We've learned a few things from American

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.210
Idol.
So we will have user votes as part of the

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.929
judging.
We think this contest is going to be really,

00:31:59.929 --> 00:32:04.380
really exciting.
Number two, I'd like to announce that we're

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:10.340
going to give away to every conference attendee
today, all 4,000 of you --

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:16.650
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: I'll show you another 
-- it's still coming on here, this example.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:21.279
This man is talking about giving away Android
phones.

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:26.630
And he's also giving away something else that's
pretty interesting.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.799
&gt;&gt;Video: We went one step further.
Included in every device --

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:36.210
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: He's giving away salmon.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:41.250
Sorry.
Not today, though.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:48.059
Really, he is talking about sim, SIM, the
sim cards that we put in phones.

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:54.919
Context, you can sort of figure it out.
But you will see many of those types of mistakes.

00:32:54.919 --> 00:33:01.919
And that leads me to another big thing that
I want to talk about here.

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:09.419
And that is quality.
Remember, our mission is to try and make all

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:15.659
the information accessible to everyone.
And that includes video.

00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:22.659
But right now, we can only recognize English
and do the machine translation for English.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:31.260
And within the English videos, some are not
very suitable, because there may be background

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.419
noise.
And that includes music.

00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:41.419
That's noisy.
Strong accents, strange vocabulary.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:48.640
So you will see a lot of different captions
that aren't what they're speaking.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:55.640
But we are concerned about the quality.
In fact, during the development of this, we

00:33:55.929 --> 00:34:01.760
had many discussions at Google and YouTube,
asking ourselves, is this good enough?

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.840
Should we wait until we have improvements?
Should we launch now?

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.970
I kept saying, no, don't worry about it.
I like it.

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:13.960
I love it.
Compared to nothing, oh, this is wonderful.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:20.960
It's important to me that I know for any video,
I can get the best-quality captions possible.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:27.050
I know they won't be great or perfect.
But I know, over time, we will get them better

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.649
and continue to improve.
That's important.

00:34:29.649 --> 00:34:36.649
We'll continue improving these.
Fortunately, Google and YouTube have a strong

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.020
culture, as Vint already mentioned.
We launch early and quickly.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:51.520
We do beta launches.
As fast as we can get it out there, that's

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.070
 -- means the faster we get feedback, do people
like this?

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.730
Do they not like it?
What do they like?

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:03.730
What do they want us to focus on?
What do we work on next?

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:10.270
So you're part of this experiment.
In fact, that's a big reason why we've invited

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.630
all of you here today.
So you can help us.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:21.630
You're the first people to see this.
And we want you to give us feedback.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:28.960
We'll have plenty of time for that during
the Q&amp;A, I hope.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:35.960
And also after that.
One last thing I want to add about how to

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:43.750
improve the quality.
You know, machine-generated captions, these

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:51.230
automated captions, are not perfect.
It will -- it takes a very long time before

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:57.420
it will ever reach the quality of human-made
captions.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:03.270
So what are we going to do about that?
So for looking at this, I'd like to take the

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.869
problem and sort of look on the other side
and see.

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:12.300
We've tried to lower the bar for accessibility
for those who are watching the videos.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.380
But what about the people who own videos,
who are uploading the videos?

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:23.380
How do we lower the barriers for them?
To help answer that question, one of -- that

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.609
will be our next speaker.
I've kind of teased her, given her the title

00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:32.640
as caption evangelist.
And this is Naomi.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.080
Naomi B., are you standing here?
[ Applause ]

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:40.010
&gt;&gt;Naomi Bilodeau: Thank you, Ken.
So I thought I would start by telling you

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.330
a little bit about me.
I'm a channel owner on YouTube.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.839
How many of you know what that means?
No idea.

00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:51.150
Okay.
How many of you have ever uploaded a video

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.359
to YouTube?
So all of you are channel owners.

00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:58.790
A channel owner is just somebody who's logged
into YouTube and uploaded a video.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.099
So I'm a channel owner for Google channels
and YouTube channels.

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:06.510
So you can imagine, I upload a lot of video
content.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:11.849
So what I'd like to talk to you about today
is, as a channel owner on YouTube, there are

00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:14.760
three things.
First, I'm going to show you how captioning

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.740
works now in YouTube for everyone.
Second, I'm going to show you a new feature,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:25.310
another new feature, also from speech recognition,
that helps channel owners.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:29.500
And, third, I'm going to show you how the
automatic captioning that Ken already showed

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.880
you, how that helps channel owners with their
content captioning efforts.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:38.330
So, first of all, I'm going to show you how
a channel owner would upload captions now.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.530
This isn't new.
This has been working on YouTube since 2008.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.500
So if I want to upload captions, the first
thing I need is a caption file.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:53.500
Let me show you what that looks like.
So I'm opening this file on my desktop.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.380
It's called EricKeynote.SBV.
This is a caption file.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.920
There's no one caption format.
This is an example of one.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.440
But, in fact, there's no standard.
But most caption files look pretty similar.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:06.690
Let me see if this mike is on.
Excellent, it is.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:13.450
So I'm going to come over here and show you
what's in this file.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.810
You're probably not familiar with this.
At the top of the file, I have some numbers.

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:20.480
In fact, that line contains two numbers, separated
by a comma.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.930
I first number tells YouTube or any video
player when to start playing the text.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.150
The second number tells it when to stop playing
the text.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.980
And then below it, we have text.
And in this example, these captions actually

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.810
tell me a little bit about what's going on.
The first text says "man" and then there's

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.200
a colon.
So I know who's speaking.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.650
Then there's a line break and it says "ladies
and gentlemen" and there's a comma.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:47.010
And then the next caption starts.
You can see, again, we have a time code.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.359
As we go through the file, this file is just
text.

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:53.910
I can open it in any text editor.
We have every single caption that I want to

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:57.240
show in the video.
So anybody who can prepare a file like this

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:02.010
can add captions to their video.
This is much easier than doing video production.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.310
Let me show you how this works.
So I'm going to go back into YouTube here,

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:03.849
I'm going to close this file.
Goodbye, file.

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:08.869
And I'm going to go find that video.
Oh, sorry.

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:15.869
I've just forgotten what file that was.
Okay, it's Eric's keynote.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:23.640
Let's go Google I/O keynote, day two.
And this is actually one of the videos that

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:30.770
I uploaded on my channel, which is called
the Google developer's channel.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:38.070
If you went to the URL, you would find my
videos.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.099
Here it is.
Here's the keynote.

00:39:39.099 --> 00:39:42.580
You've seen this video already; right?
Do you remember -- Let me turn that off.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.630
It's noisy.
Okay.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:51.140
So I click over here on captions and subtitles.
This option appears because I'm the video

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:56.820
owner.
And I click add new captions or transcript,

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.960
and I choose my file.
And I go over here.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.250
Here's my file, Eric keynote.SBV.
I choose it and give it the language.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.290
Ken showed you a video that had lots of different
languages.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:14.040
I can add different languages here.
I tell it what language the video is in, English.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.280
I say, upload it, go.
There it is.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.829
So here I can click on "English."
And here's my time code file.

00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:26.099
So here we are in YouTube.
I have time codes.

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:29.020
I have start time code, end time code.
Here's the text.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.079
YouTube knows all that information that was
in my text file and it can use it to play

00:40:33.079 --> 00:40:36.190
those captions on the video.
This is my file.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.000
I own it.
If I want to, I can go download the caption

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.570
file later if I don't remember where I stored
it.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:47.849
And I can take that file, send it out to translation,
and then I can get a French or Spanish version

00:40:47.849 --> 00:40:51.440
or maybe a Klingon version.
I don't think Klingon is officially supported

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.430
on YouTube.
But we could upload them.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:41:01.430
Let me go back.
That's how we uploaded captions to video on

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.770
YouTube.
When I saw this feature, I got really excited.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:09.349
This is how I met Ken and how I became a caption
evangelist at Google.

00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:12.250
I thought, this is amazing.
I have to go forth and caption every video

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.410
that Google posts, because this is so easy
and so awesome.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:19.200
We have to go do this.
So that worked out really well for me.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.220
But I looked around, and I noticed there weren't
a lot of channels that were captioning their

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.530
videos.
And I wondered why that was.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.740
And I think the reason is, uploading videos
to YouTube is really easy.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.780
It's simple.
But preparing a time code file is hard for

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.579
a lot of people.
Imagine a young teenager who's uploading videos

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:41.410
for their friends to YouTube.
They're not going to have this kind of expertise

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.930
and they're probably not going to be that
interested in learning.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:50.579
So could we make this any easier?
And the answer is, yes.

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:53.010
So now I'm going to show you a second new
feature.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.829
This new feature is called automatic timing
for captions on YouTube.

00:41:56.829 --> 00:42:01.329
And this is something that all channel owners,
once we launch this later this week, all channel

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:08.280
owners on YouTube will be able to do this.
So the first question is, okay, so to do this,

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.829
rather than make a caption file, what I'm
going to show you is a transcript file.

00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:16.520
Here's an example of one for a video we shot
last week.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.160
This is a video we're going to post to the
Google blog.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.900
It shows you how to use all these features.
So here's the text.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.000
We prepared the text ahead of time, because
when we were shooting the video, we didn't

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.230
want to make mistakes.
We filmed this text.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.619
We have somebody speaking it in the voiceover.
So I already have this.

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:39.619
Now I'm going to go into YouTube, and I'm
going to go to my channel.

00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:42.440
Here's my videos.
I'm going to click here on "captions."

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.280
This is just -- if you're a channel owner,
you might be familiar with this view.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.820
This is where you can see all of your videos.
And in this view, the button says "captions."

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.760
But it's actually taking us to the same page
here.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:57.760
And now I can click "add new captions or transcript."
I'm going to choose a file, just like I did

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:03.950
before.
And I say, okay, now I have this option here.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.220
We -- our old file we did, that was a captioned
file.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.680
Now there's another option in YouTube that
says "transcript file."

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.790
It says "English only," because this is relying
on speech-to-text technology, right now, we

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:20.599
can only do that for English.
And I say, okay, upload file, go.

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:21.369
This is going to take a little while.
So I'm going to talk.

00:43:21.369 --> 00:43:28.369
One of the things that I think is important
to mention, Ken has already told you why captions

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.329
 -- I'm going to take this so I can wander
around -- Ken has already told you why captions

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:35.320
are important for viewers.
And you know why they're important for viewers,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.680
because you're viewers.
But I'm a channel owner.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.930
So I want to tell you why this is important
for me.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:43.700
Captions are important to me because I want
to reach a bigger audience.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:48.869
If I caption my videos, I can reach deaf and
hard of hearing audience, I can reach people

00:43:48.869 --> 00:43:52.790
who may be immigrants to the United States,
who read English well but don't understand

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.920
it well when it's spoken.
I can reach people who hadn't found my video

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.060
except they did a search and the caption file
came up.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:04.290
So you can see that as a video owner, by adding
a captioned file to my video, whether I'm

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:08.630
doing it from a captioned file or a transcript,
as I'm about to show you, adding these captions

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.490
make that video much more useful and much
more accessible to a really wide audience.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:16.040
So, to me as a channel owner, this is really
important and exciting.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:22.470
Because I want my videos to be watched by
as many people as possible.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:26.869
Okay.
Let me actually go back -- actually, it's

00:44:26.869 --> 00:44:28.760
done.
I'm going to do this in different order because

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.930
it finished so quickly.
Hang on.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:35.040
Let me show you what's happened.
Remember, we uploaded that video file?

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.040
Let me show you the file in case you've forgotten
while I was telling you about how awesome

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.790
captions are.
Here's what the file is, just text.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:49.359
And I go here.
And now I have this in YouTube.

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:54.089
You see there are time codes here?
So what YouTube did is it took my transcript

00:44:54.089 --> 00:44:59.170
file and it went through it and it said, when
were these words spoken aloud in the video?

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:04.089
And it computed a time code.
And then it calculated the time code for me.

00:45:04.089 --> 00:45:07.290
So I don't have to go to all the trouble of
figuring out where those time codes are.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.070
I don't know if any of you have ever tried
to make a caption file, but it's a little

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.020
bit fiddley.
So YouTube did this for me.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.240
All I had to have was the text, and I already
had it.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.410
Now I have a caption file.
I can download it.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.680
Let me show you.
Here it is.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.400
It's gone to my desktop.
Let's go open it.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.599
Here's the file.
It's called captions .SBV.text.

00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:36.470
Oh, look, caption file.
Let me show you these side by side so you

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.800
can really see the difference.
Okay.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.800
So here on the left --
[ Applause ]

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:59.040
&gt;&gt;Naomi Bilodeau: So you guys are applauding
me because I'm the one up here with the mike.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:10.530
But I really have to thank the guys on the
Google audio team who built the amazing speech-to-text

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.810
technology that makes this happen and the
people at YouTube and people like Ken.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.869
There's a lot of pieces at Google that all
came together to make this happen.

00:46:17.869 --> 00:46:21.680
I'm just standing up here with the mike telling
you how awesome this is.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.859
So let me tell you how awesome this is.
Over here, we have the time codes.

00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:31.170
You can see, if you look at the original transcript,
it's actually put in line breaks for me.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.349
Where I had line breaks, it's respecting them.
You can see today starts on its own line.

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:38.460
And again in the caption file, it starts on
its own line.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.609
So if I, as the video owner, want to control
where the line breaks are, I can put in line

00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:46.640
breaks, and they'll come through to the caption.
And if I don't know what I'm doing and I don't

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:52.109
care, I can make one big long paragraph and
it will break it into nice-length captions.

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:55.940
I can -- I downloaded this file from YouTube.
You saw that wasn't very hard.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:01.280
I can take that file and send it for translation.
I might want to adjust where the caption breaks

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.030
are.
I can do that, 'cause I have all the time

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.310
codes.
Now I'm going to show you one last thing.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:12.349
Let's go back to Safari.
Let's go back all the way.

00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:19.349
Let me find that video.
Google I/O keynote.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:26.770
I want to find the video that Ken showed you
with Vic Gundotra speaking.

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:32.970
Let's see.
It's part 10, the one where he gives away

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.710
the phones.
Here it is.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.569
Okay.
So I'm the channel owner.

00:47:37.569 --> 00:47:42.040
I own this video.
And this video happens to have been machine-transcribed

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.380
using the caption transcript feature that
Ken showed you.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:52.380
So if I go into captions and subtitles, I'm
just clicking here as the owner, I see this

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.410
track here.
It says English, machine transcription.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.089
What is this?
This is the speech-to-text transcript that

00:47:57.089 --> 00:48:01.140
was provided for me.
So I can click on this.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.690
And you see here, I have time codes.
I have text.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:11.339
No person created these time-coded captions.
In some cases, they will be pretty bad.

00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:13.839
In other cases, like this one, they're actually
quite good.

00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:20.190
So I can go over here, click download.
Let's go back to my desktop to find it.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.000
Where did it go?
It's this one, I think.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.569
Captions 1.SBV.
Here it is.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:31.849
It's the time-coded file, produced by machine.
And I can go in and I can find that line about

00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:33.790
the salmon.
I can fix it.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:39.180
And I can reupload it.
So what this technology has done as a channel

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.089
owner is, it's saved me an awful a lot of
typing.

00:48:42.089 --> 00:48:46.260
So I've just shown you some new features from
the channel owner's side that we really hope

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.589
are going to help more channel owners add
more captions to their videos.

00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:53.760
With that, I'd like to hand this back to Vint.
[ Applause ]

00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:00.760
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Well, you've just seen how powerful
computing technology can be, especially when

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:10.599
all the different parts of communications
can be linked together.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:17.980
And here, you've seen the merging of various
kinds of technology, speech-to-text, we haven't

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:23.450
got text-to-speech demonstrated here, but
we do that, too.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:29.609
What's important here is the enabling capability
that you've just seen.

00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:36.609
I'll be very interested to hear from Marc
Okrand and others whose work involves producing

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.410
these things.
My guess is that this kind of technology can

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:48.190
make this whole process much more efficient,
and, therefore, much easier and perhaps less

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.910
costly to accomplish, which means more video
can be captioned.

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:58.720
Now, we have an opportunity to do some Q&amp;A.
I'm going to go to that in just a moment.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.160
I actually have a bunch of questions myself
for my colleagues.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.490
So if no one else asks anything, I've got
a whole bunch of them, just listening to what's

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:12.140
going on here.
But this is simply a stunning example of what

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:18.079
happens when you put technologists together
with different kinds of expertise.

00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:23.819
We have a research group -- I'm part of that
group, although I don't claim to have contributed

00:50:23.819 --> 00:50:27.619
very much, and certainly nothing here except
enthusiasm.

00:50:27.619 --> 00:50:32.810
But what's important is that the speech understanding
group, the speech recognition group, had to

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.440
come together with the people who understood
ways in which to do captions.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.560
Now, here's something interesting about what
you just saw.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.230
The way the captions work in the YouTube world
is different from the way the captions work

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:53.230
in today's video world.
You are aware, I'm sure, of the late '70s,

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:58.920
when we had line 21 captioning, and we fought
very hard, some of us, to put that in, even

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.440
though there were people saying, well, there
were better ways to do it and we should wait

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:08.190
until video text was available, because it
would have a wider variety of symbols that

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.720
could be expressed.
And most of us said, the heck with that.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.020
Just get something up so we can appreciate
video like everyone else does.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:21.700
Then, of course, we've come to high-definition
television.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.579
By the way, I should tell you that YouTube
has just announced that it can put up 1080P,

00:51:26.579 --> 00:51:32.339
the highest resolution, highest definition
that you can watch on YouTube.

00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.460
So we're moving ahead with the rest of the
industry.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:41.250
But some of you probably know that high-definition
captioning hasn't worked terribly well.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:47.160
It's, I would say, erratic.
The Federal Communications Commission has

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:53.329
a whole group assigned to work on that problem.
And I can tell you that on behalf of Google,

00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:56.359
I'm going to be digging as deep into that
as I can.

00:51:56.359 --> 00:52:00.710
But what's very interesting about what you're
seeing here is that the captions are being

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:05.109
delivered differently than they are with traditional
television.

00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:11.329
They are distinct and separate channels, so
to speak, not in the sense that Naomi was

00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:17.710
talking about, but in the sense of the source
of the captions is independent of the video.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.450
They're obviously linked together by the time
codes.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:27.310
But because they are segregated, we can do
all these things to manipulate the text file.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:32.839
We can translate from one language to another.
We can automatically do the partitioning.

00:52:32.839 --> 00:52:36.339
We can give you the transcript so you can
do editing on it.

00:52:36.339 --> 00:52:43.170
You don't have to have all the kinds of equipment
that are needed to decode the captions or

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:46.349
to encode the captions.
It's a separate process.

00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:53.160
This separation of the two media, the text
medium and the video medium, creates opportunities

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:59.260
that would not otherwise exist.
And so when you think about things like I.P.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:06.260
TV, you should not be thinking of just generating
and distributing a kind of condensed combined

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:16.970
medium, but, rather, one in which the separation
is important because of the ability to manipulate

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.339
it.
And so if we're looking towards the future

00:53:19.339 --> 00:53:25.160
of this medium, the ability to separately
manage these different streams is absolutely

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.940
critical.
Oddly enough, there is something kind of like

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.150
that in the video world where you have different
audio overlays.

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:38.180
You can have different channels with different
audio for Spanish and English and French and

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.280
so on.
But here, we are keeping these media distinct

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:47.400
and manipulable.
I don't have much to say in closing, except

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.410
I want to acknowledge some people who have
made this happen.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:57.589
And to do that, if you'll hold onto the microphone
for a minute.

00:53:57.589 --> 00:54:03.000
Glasses again.
Okay.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.000
So -- I hate paper -- there.
Okay, so not everyone is here, but a lot of

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.190
people are here.
I'm going to name the folks who are here,

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:26.849
and plus a few that aren't.
I want them to please stand up and accept

00:54:26.849 --> 00:54:30.730
our recognition of the wonderful work that's
been done.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.339
So Ken Harrenstien, will you stand up for
a minute.

00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:40.119
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: And Naomi.

00:54:40.119 --> 00:54:43.099
And Toliver Jue, where is Toliver?
Okay.

00:54:43.099 --> 00:54:45.200
There.
Greg Millam?

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.730
Is Greg here?
Chris Alberti.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.770
Michiel Bacchiani.
[ Applause ]

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:59.589
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: And you saw Hiroto Tokusei.
But he isn't here.

00:54:59.589 --> 00:55:02.540
He's off in Japan.
But we thank him for his work, too.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.530
And Jonas Klink, finally.
[ Applause ]

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:12.530
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: You see these tee shirts.
And they are indicative of Google's determination

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:24.760
to make accessibility a part, a real part,
of its motto and its objectives in the world.

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.240
I hope that we're going to see lots of other
tee shirts with lots of other indications

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.130
of accessibility progress that we make at
Google.
